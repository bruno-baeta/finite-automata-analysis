Finite Automata Analysis is a tool for the Computational Theory course (BCC-244) at UFOP. It simplifies creating and manipulating DFAs and NFAs, computes transition functions, finds minimal equivalent automata, and converts NFA to DFA and epsilon-NFA to NFA. The user-friendly interface aids in learning finite automata concepts.
